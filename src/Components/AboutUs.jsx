                                    Cochin International Airport, owned and operated by Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), is the first airport in India built under Public Private Partnership (PPP). Remarkably, it is the world's first fully solar-powered airport. Located 28 km northeast of downtown Kochi, it ranks as the third busiest for international passengers and seventh largest overall in India. As of 2022, Cochin Airport handles 61.8% of Kerala's total air passenger movement. CIAL is a winner of the prestigious ' Champions of the Earth ' award instituted by United Nations for its pioneering effort which showed the world that it is possible for large power consumers like an airport to switch over to sustainable utility model for its energy needs. At present the total installed capacity of CIAL's green energy initiatives is 50 MWp producing 200,000 units of power daily. The airport features three terminals, including India's first charter gatewayâ€” an exclusive Business Jet Terminal. For over 24 years of dedicated service, Cochin International Airport has seamlessly connected 31 countries, collaborating with 24 airlines and welcoming more than 10 million passengers annually to its world-class facilities. Despite not being publicly listed, the company has a robust foundation with 19,000 investors hailing from 28 countries, primarily expatriate Keralites. This diverse investor base has played a crucial role in nurturing the airport, a significant undertaking materialized by the State Government, which remains the largest investor with a stake of approximately 34%. Notably, the company has consistently paid dividend since 2003-04, with a cumulative payout reaching 317%. The airport, featuring three terminals, collectively possesses a peak-hour handling capacity of 8,000 passengers.CIAL has already earned a well-deserved reputation for its operational efficiency and strict adherence to international standards. For the past four years, CIAL has been recognized as the "Best Airport" in the Asia-Pacific region by the Airports Council International (ACI) with 5 to 15 million passengers. The airport started its operation on 25th May 1999, since then the traffic and revenue parameters have registered a steady growth. Being the founder Chairman, Sri. K. Karunakaran, former Chief Minister of Kerala was instrumental in the acutuation of the project. The pathbreaking idea of building an airport under PPP model, that too for the first time in the country was put forward by Sri. V.J.Kurian IAS and his visionary leadership as the founder Managing Director turned out to be decisive in materializing the project which was once disdained as a faux pas . Hon. Chief Minister Sri. Pinarayi Vijayan is the current Chairman of the company whose guidance and administrative capabilities have been contributing to the stunning performance exhibited by the company in recent years. Sri. S.Suhas IAS assumed charge as the Managing Director in June 2021 and now is steering the vision of the company by implementing mega infrastructure development programmes and ensuring a sustainable growth to all verticals. Owing to the financial restructuring and aggressive marketing impelemnted by the Board of the Directors, the company has witnessed growth in both revenue and traffic. CIAL became the sole airport in the country during the post pandemic year to register a profit. In 2021-22, the company logged a profit of Rs.37.68 crore and in 2022-23 the profit increased to Rs.267 crores. In its 24 years of operational history, it handled 10 million passenger in a calander year in 2023.

                                <h3>Green Initiatives</h3>
                                <p>Green Initiatives
                                    CIAL believes in the responsibility to venture into projects producing green energy and thereby lessening our carbon footprint. In 2015, Cochin International Airport became the world's first fully solar powered airport with the inauguration of a dedicated solar plant. CIAL also ventured into a hydroelectric project which was commissioned in 2021. The hydropower plant located at Iruvanjippuzha in Arippara, Kozhikode district, has an installed capacity of producing 4.5MW. CIAL also inaugurated a new solar power plant on 06th March 2022 elevating its status of being a power neutral airport to a power positive airport. The 12 MWp Payyanur plant is situated at Ettukudukka near Payyanur, Kerala. With the commissioning of Payyanur plant the cumulative installed capacity of solar plants of CIAL has been scaled up to 50 MWp. These include seven plants functioning in the premises of the airport, a solar carport and the one at Payyanur. CIALâ€™s solar power plants together generate two hundred thousand (2 lakhs) units of power a day whereas the airportâ€™s daily power consumption stands at 1.6 hundred thousand units. For this entrepreneurial vision, the airport won the coveted â€˜Champion of the Earthâ€™ award in 2018, the highest environmental honour instituted by the United Nations.</p>

                                <p>Aviation is one of the fields which is being reprimanded for the production of greenhouse gases. At this juncture, CIAL believes in the responsibility to venture into projects producing green energy and thereby reducing our carbon footprints. In 2015, the airport installed a massive solar power plant, becoming the first airport in the world to operate entirely on solar energy. This initiative has not only reduced the carbon footprint but has also significantly reduced operating costs. At present, Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) generates a remarkable 73 million units of clean and green energy on an annual basis. cumulative installed capacity of CIALâ€™s green projects is 50 MW. CIAL generates 2 lakh units of power daily, while its daily power consumption stands at 1.6 lakh units. This impressive power production positions CIAL as the second-largest power producer in Kerala after Kerala State Electricity Board.</p>
